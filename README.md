**Description**

This is my final project for my intermediate pyrthon class in college. The concept is that it's a test of dedication to a friendship. 
You are meant to send it to a friend and they are meant to complete it. 
It is purposely rude to them and it's pretty difficult to complete. I could have improved this more but I ran out of time.

If you can't figure out the answers to the riddles, check the functions file.

There are 6 different files with code:

Main = Small amounts of code that only calls the functions from other files.

Input_box = This holds all of the code that works around the input box (where the player writes responses).

Variables = Contains all of variables that are used in the different files.

Slow_print = This holds all of the code that makes it so that the dialogue looks typed out, instead of instant. Also contains the positioning of the dialogue.

Loading_screen = This holds all of the code that makes a loading screen, default loading from black to grey, but can be changed to whatever colors.

Functions_for_Trial = Holds all of the functions that basically makes it a game, like the dialogue.


**Usage**

Just run the main file.
