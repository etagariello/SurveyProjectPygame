**DESCRIPTION**

This is my final project for my intermediate pyrthon class in college. The concept is that it's a test of dedication to a friendship. 
You are meant to send it to a friend and they are meant to complete it. 
It is purposely rude to them and it's pretty difficult to complete. I could have improved this more but I ran out of time.
They are two different ending to find.

If you can't figure out the answers to the riddles, check the functions file.

IF you can't figure out a valid response to the "how much do you know them", check the variables file.

**There are 6 different files with code:**

**Main** = Small amounts of code that only calls the functions from other files.

**Input_box** = This holds all of the code that works around the input box (where the player writes responses).

**Variables** = Contains all of variables that are used in the different files.

**Slow_print** = This holds all of the code that makes it so that the dialogue looks typed out, instead of instant. Also contains the positioning of the dialogue.

**Loading_screen** = This holds all of the code that makes a loading screen, default loading from black to grey, but can be changed to whatever colors.

**Functions_for_Trial** = Holds all of the functions that basically makes it a game, like the dialogue.


**READ ONLY IF YOU HAVE COMPLETED THE GAME AND FOUND BOTH ENDINGS**
The secret meaning to this project is supposed to represent my commitment to this project... or it could be taken into general aspect.

The **"Good Ending?"** is meant to represent how after many fails you eventually succeeded at the problem you were facing, and moved on with life.

The **"Better Ending?"** is meant to represent how after completing your probelm immediately and flawlessly, you decided to stay and do it forever, which we can compare it to video game addictions (since its usually caused by immaculate skill) or workaholics. And the reason why it says "...Alone?" is because the person that we are talking to is actually meant to be your consciousness pushing you to improve, but if you have already achieved max skill, then you are simply alone.

**USAGE**

Just run the main file.
